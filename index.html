      <p class = "about-text">
        Hello! I'm Vanshika. I have a growing interest in AI and Machine Learning, and I enjoy exploring how intelligent systems can make technology more efficient and human-centered. I’ve also worked on several full-stack projects, which helped me build strong problem-solving and development skills.
        <br><br>
        I'm currently an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CSE 2221 at The Ohio State University. This has strengthened my understanding of core CS concepts especially Object Oriented Programming and my ability to explain them clearly.
        <br><br>
        I am a member of the Society of Women Engineers and hold a chair role in the OSU chapter. I am also a peer mentor to upcoming CSE students. In my leisure time, I like to do art journaling and listen to music.
